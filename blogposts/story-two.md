- Do not underestimate the power of small steps to build a great future!
- Money is not the diference between a rich and poor man but its only a result of the differences (it is a by product)
- The fundamental difference is their mindset!
- RIch people think diferently than poor and middle class poeple.
- the rich understand the value of knowledge.
- real education start after school
- Just like education, broke people do not respect time!
- they do not recognize the true value of time ( broke people ).
- rich people do not trade time for money but they trade vaue for money meaning that they get paid in direct proportion with the value they deliver.
- think about trading value for money not time!
- Think about what value you can create for other people and how you can deliver that value.
- recognise the strengths and competency and go all in. The more value you can delive the more you can pay
- it has nothing to do with working from 9-5

#### CREATE YOUR REALITY

- poor people believes that life justs happens to them
- your thoughts shape your reality!
- play to win
- Poor people when playing the money games are primary concerned about "survival and security" not "wealth and abundance"
- Rich people's goals is to have massive wealth and abundance while poor people's goals are to have enough to pay the biils on time.
- poor people may say they want financial freedom but their true intentions is just to make enough to survive.

#### AVOID THE PROBLEMS

- rich people are bigger than their problems but poor people are smaller than their problems
- poor people will do almost anything to avoid almost anything that could look like to be a problem, they back away from challenges
- the idea is to grow yourself to a place where you can overcome any problems that get into your way.
- rich people do not back away from problem, do not avoid problem and do not complain about having problem.
- rich people are financial warriors and when a warrior is confronted with a challenge they say bring it on!

#### PRODUCE

- a rich mindset loves to create and produce, they get joy from seeing their ideas come to life.
